## Insights
# Mainstream & Budget Older Families, Mainstream Retirees, and Mainstream Young Singles/Couples are driving most chip sales.
# Premium customers buy fewer chips overall, less engaged with the category.
# Big sales from Mainstream Retirees and Young Singles/Couples are due to their large numbers.
# Budget Older Families punch above their weight — fewer in number but buy a lot of chips.
# Families (Older & Young) buy more chip units per person.
# Price per pack is steady, but Mainstream Young Singles/Couples pay slightly more, possibly open to premium products.

# Create a unit price column

```

```{r}
# Mainstream Young Singles/Couples pay an average of $4.07 per chip pack
# Budget Young Singles/Couples pay around $3.66 per pack
# p-value < 2.2 → statistically significant difference
# Mainstream customers in this lifestage are willing to pay more, a solid premium positioning opportunity

# Segment Deep Dive: Mainstream Young Singles/Couples

# This segment buys the most chips among young customers and pays more per pack (confirmed by t-test).
# Top brands: Kettle, Pringles, Doritos — suggests preference for premium/well-known options.
# Most popular pack size: 175g by far, followed by 150g and 135g (mid-sized packs are key).

# Strategic Rec:
# Focus marketing on Mainstream Young Singles/Couples.
# Run promos on 150g–175g packs of premium brands like Kettle/Pringles.
# Try limited-edition flavors or slight price bumps, they’ll likely accept it.
